# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

An **intermediate-level machine learning project** focused on detecting fraudulent transactions using advanced classification techniques. The project applies robust preprocessing, handles class imbalance, and evaluates multiple models to maximize fraud detection accuracy.

## 📌 Project Description

This project demonstrates the use of **machine learning classification algorithms** to identify **potentially fraudulent credit card transactions** from a real-world dataset. The dataset is highly imbalanced, and the objective is to build models that can **reliably distinguish fraud from legitimate transactions**.

Key goals include:

- Applying **advanced classification algorithms** to detect fraud.
- Tackling the **challenges of class imbalance**.
- Evaluating and comparing multiple models using robust metrics.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand and handle **imbalanced datasets** using techniques like **oversampling**, **undersampling**, and **class weighting**.
- Implement and evaluate **advanced classification algorithms** such as:
  - Random Forest
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Tune hyperparameters and apply **cross-validation** for better generalization.
- Perform **data preprocessing**, **feature scaling**, and **model evaluation** using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
